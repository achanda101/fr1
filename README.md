# Recovering Food Narratives Portal

A digital repository documenting food and farming transitions in western Avadh, Uttar Pradesh, India. This portal presents research findings from a collaborative study between Sangtin farmer-labourer collective and IIT Delhi, exploring historical and contemporary diets, agricultural practices, and their cultural significance.

## About

Born from research presented at IIIT Bangalore in 2019, this portal makes academic research on food systems accessible to broader audiences through digital storytelling. The project documents the rich history of regional recipes, cultural practices around food and health, and the complex factors driving dietary and agricultural transitions.
